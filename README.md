# Brennan_CSCI2270_Final
Project Summary:
For my project I'm going to provide information about different instruments, the user will be able to learn different facts and pieces of information about them.  They can select their favorite instruments and it will be added to a vector, the user can add or remove different instruments from this vector. They can also add instruments not already listed in the program.  They can then print lists of instruments by instrument type or alphabetically.  They can also count the total number of instruments.  Furthermore they can search to see if an instrument is already in the list of instruments. The information for the instruments will be stored in a struct in the form of a binary search tree and instrumets will be divided into different vectors depending on the type of instrument they are.
